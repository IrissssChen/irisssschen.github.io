3/22 [Water (Product Intro Page)](https://irisssschen.github.io/)
* For International Water Day
* Stock I made the last year. Modifications today to make it more legible

2/26 Memory Game
* I might do an experiment with the game?
* Part about creating the grid cr. mohit-chawla @ github
* Game idea cr. [Purple Development](https://www.facebook.com/PurpleDevelopment)
* I spent a long time trying to fix a bug. I thought it's in the JS but it turns out it's something about CSS

1/19 Unravel (Travelling Information Website)
* Style: #modern #elegant #clean
* File size: 16 KB (HTML + CSS) + 20.3KB (JS)
* Interactive features: add-and-remove wishlist, random portal that is actually random
* Stylistically, this might be my favorite project yet. I made the interface with what **I** consider beautiful instead of copying trends
* This project is way too large for me at my current skill level. I started it in November and worked on it for 15+ hours. My code is not 100% clean, but I got it working
* External help: [new Date().getTime() gets milliseconds since page is loaded when passed as argument into a function](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70728609/new-date-gettime-gets-milliseconds-since-page-is-loaded-when-passed-as-argum) (I didn't end up using the feature I asked about though)
* *The jumbotron is not a picture of an ocean - it's the product image of a wallpaper I found at @wallsneedlove*
