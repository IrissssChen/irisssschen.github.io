* Style: #modern #elegant #clean
* File size: 16 KB (HTML + CSS) + 20.3KB (JS)
* Interactive features: add-and-remove wishlist, random portal that is actually random
* Stylistically, his might be my favorite project yet! I made the interface with what **I** consider beautiful instead of copying trends
* I never imagined that I'll write 100+ lines of JS... I don't know how I did it. 
* This project is way too large for me at my current skill level. I started it in November and worked on it for 15+ hours. My code is not 100% clean, but I got it working
* External help: [new Date().getTime() gets milliseconds since page is loaded when passed as argument into a function](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70728609/new-date-gettime-gets-milliseconds-since-page-is-loaded-when-passed-as-argum) (I didn't end up using the feature I asked about, but I learned a new thing)
* *The jumbotron is not a picture of an ocean - it's the product image of a wallpaper I found at @wallsneedlove*
